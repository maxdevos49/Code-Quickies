# Code Quickies

Programs written in a short amount of time to learn or brush up on programming skills.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of short, one-off programs written in various programming languages. Each program is designed to explore specific concepts, techniques, or features. Some programs may be unfinished as my time is cut short or interest goes elsewhere.

## Structure
Code is organized by language and/or runtime (e.g., `C/`, `node/`, `deno/`, etc.).
